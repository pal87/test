<!--
parallel="methods":  TestNG will run all your test methods in separate threads. 
					 Dependent methods will also run in separate threads but they 
					 will respect the order that you specified.
					
parallel="tests":    TestNG will run all the methods in the same tag in the same thread, 
					 but each tag will be in a separate thread. This allows you to group 
					 all your classes that are not thread safe in the same and guarantee 
					 they will all run in the same thread while taking advantage of TestNG 
					 using as many threads as possible to run your tests.
						
parallel="classes":   TestNG will run all the methods in the same class in the same thread, 
					  but each class will be run in a separate thread.
					  
parallel="instances": TestNG will run all the methods in the same instance in the same thread, 
					  but two methods on two different instances will be running in different threads.
